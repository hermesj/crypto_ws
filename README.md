# crypto_ws

A project designed for my workshop on cryptology (2015-09-05)
This is an eclipse project, hence it can be easyly imported into the eclipse program which we know from the workshop.
All you have to do is to download this project, starting eclipse, rigtht-click the "Package Explorer" field, choose "import" --> "existing project" --> specify the path to your downloaded zip-File.
Hope you get the functionality of the methods from the javadoc comments (open the doc-->index.html to see the html version). Have fun!
